`aioflo` is a Python 3, `asyncio`-friendly library for interacting with
[Flo by Moen Smart Water Detectors](https://www.moen.com/flo).

# Python Versions

`aioflo` is currently supported on:

* Python 3.6
* Python 3.7
* Python 3.8

# Installation

```python
pip install aioflo
```

# Usage

```python
import asyncio

from aiohttp import ClientSession

from aioflo import async_get_api


async def main() -> None:
    """Run!"""
    api = await async_get_api("<EMAIL>", "<PASSWORD>")

    # Get user account information:
    user_info = await api.user.get_info()
    a_location_id = user_info["locations"][0]["id"]

    # Get location (i.e., device) information:
    location_info = await api.location.get_info(a_location_id)

    # Get consumption info between a start and end datetime:
    consumption_info = await api.water.get_consumption_info(
        a_location_id,
        datetime(2020, 1, 16, 0, 0),
        datetime(2020, 1, 16, 23, 59, 59, 999000),
    )

    # Get various other metrics related to water usage:
    metrics = await api.water.get_metrics(
        "<DEVICE_MAC_ADDRESS>",
        datetime(2020, 1, 16, 0, 0),
        datetime(2020, 1, 16, 23, 59, 59, 999000),
    )

    # Set the device in "Away" mode:
    await set_mode_away(a_location_id)

    # Set the device in "Home" mode:
    await set_mode_home(a_location_id)

    # Set the device in "Sleep" mode for 120 minutes, then return to "Away" mode:
    await set_mode_sleep(a_location_id, 120, "away")


asyncio.run(main())
```

By default, the library creates a new connection to Flo with each coroutine. If you are
calling a large number of coroutines (or merely want to squeeze out every second of
runtime savings possible), an
[`aiohttp`](https://github.com/aio-libs/aiohttp) `ClientSession` can be used for connection
pooling:

```python
import asyncio

from aiohttp import ClientSession

from aioflo import async_get_api


async def main() -> None:
    """Create the aiohttp session and run the example."""
    async with ClientSession() as websession:
        api = await async_get_api("<EMAIL>", "<PASSWORD>", session=session)

        # Get user account information:
        user_info = await api.user.get_info()
        a_location_id = user_info["locations"][0]["id"]

        # Get location (i.e., device) information:
        location_info = await api.location.get_info(a_location_id)

        # Get consumption info between a start and end datetime:
        consumption_info = await api.water.get_consumption_info(
            a_location_id,
            datetime(2020, 1, 16, 0, 0),
            datetime(2020, 1, 16, 23, 59, 59, 999000),
        )

        # Get various other metrics related to water usage:
        metrics = await api.water.get_metrics(
            "<DEVICE_MAC_ADDRESS>",
            datetime(2020, 1, 16, 0, 0),
            datetime(2020, 1, 16, 23, 59, 59, 999000),
        )

        # Set the device in "Away" mode:
        await set_mode_away(a_location_id)

        # Set the device in "Home" mode:
        await set_mode_home(a_location_id)

        # Set the device in "Sleep" mode for 120 minutes, then return to "Away" mode:
        await set_mode_sleep(a_location_id, 120, "away")


asyncio.run(main())
```
